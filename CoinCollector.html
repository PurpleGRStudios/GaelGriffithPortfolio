                    <h2>About Coin Collector</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Coin Collector" was a solo project to develop
                        an engaging game that would inspire space travel and
                        astronomy interest amongst a younger audience.
                        It marked the first partnership between Game Developers
                        and Game Artists, with each group comprising two
                        developers and four artists.
                        But our group had an extra dev who joined the project at
                        a later date. This was also the second time we worked
                        with sprints if i recall correctly.

                                To start this project off, I wanted to create a simple game
                                too learn more about Unreal Engine.
                                So I decided with a Coin Collector game.
                                I decided just collecting coins would be too easy.
                                so I created a little win/lose condition to the game.
                                If the timer runs out and you haven't colllected all the coins
                                you lose the game.

                                    In the snippet above I created a blueprint which
                                    checks if all the coins are collected before you can interact with the bridge.
                                    If this is true the bridge will open up and play a little sound, if this isn't 
                                    true the bridge will not open.

                                a healthbar system for the game for both the enemy and player.

                                By the end of this project, i've improved my
                                developing skills alot during the development
                                process of this game.
                                I learned how to work together with artists more
                                through communicating with them about Anchor
                                Points in their models for example.
                                And i had to learn each of them how Github
                                worked and i myself learned how branches worked
                                mid-process.
                                Because of our little knowledge there were some
                                bugs and errors in the Repositories so i had to
                                make 2 new ones in total.
                                also making use of Git LFS for the first time,
                                since the map file was above 100Mb.
