                    <h2>About Expanding Space</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Expanding Space" was a collaborative project to develop
                        an engaging game that would inspire space travel and
                        astronomy interest amongst a younger audience.
                        It marked the first partnership between Game Developers
                        and Game Artists, with each group comprising two
                        developers and four artists.
                        But our group had an extra dev who joined the project at
                        a later date. This was also the second time we worked
                        with sprints if i recall correctly.

                                To start this project off, we as a team were
                                brainstorming about the genre of the game, the
                                gameplay loop, and a goal and such.
                                We decided to do go for a 3D horror game with
                                parkouring and FPS elements.
                                So the artists went ahead to create their assets
                                and sketches, while i started working on a weapon pickup script.

                                    In the snippet above I created lines of code that would check
                                    if the weapon was equipped or not when pressing "n". If this wasn't true it would turn
                                    off features that you would normally be able to do with the weapon equipped. Like shooting
                                    the space rifle.

                                After making an Weapon Pickup Script I thought about
                                what would be needed to make the gun useful. So I started making
                                a healthbar system for the game for both the enemy and player.
                            </p>

                                    Here you can see the healthbar script I created for the player. The first line in the "Update Start"
                                    shows when the healthamount is eqaul to or less then zero it reloads the level.
                                    It also shows the damage you take which I put in at 10 for testing purposes. <br>

                                By the end of this project, i've improved my
                                developing skills alot during the development
                                process of this game.
                                I learned how to work together with artists more
                                through communicating with them about Anchor
                                Points in their models for example.
                                And i had to learn each of them how Github
                                worked and i myself learned how branches worked
                                mid-process.
                                Because of our little knowledge there were some
                                bugs and errors in the Repositories so i had to
                                make 2 new ones in total.
                                also making use of Git LFS for the first time,
                                since the map file was above 100Mb.
