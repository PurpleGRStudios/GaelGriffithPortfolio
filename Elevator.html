                        "Coin Collector" was a solo project to develop
                        an engaging game that would inspire space travel and
                        astronomy interest amongst a younger audience.
                        It marked the first partnership between Game Developers
                        and Game Artists, with each group comprising two
                        developers and four artists.
                        But our group had an extra dev who joined the project at
                        a later date. This was also the second time we worked
                        with sprints if i recall correctly.

                                To start this project off, I wanted to create a simple game
                                too learn more about Unreal Engine.
                                So I decided with a Coin Collector game.
                                I decided just collecting coins would be too easy.
                                so I created a little win/lose condition to the game.
                                If the timer runs out and you haven't colllected all the coins
                                you lose the game.

                                    In the snippet above I created a blueprint which
                                    checks if all the floors are ingame before you can interact with the Elevator.
                                    If this is true each number you press the elevator will go too. It will also
                                    skip numbers if those aren't in the way of a higher number. Like pressing floor 4 when
                                    you are on floor 1 it will instantly go there. unless someone else has pressed any other number
                                    between 1 and 4 it will go to the highest floor pressed.

                               Biggest issue I was noticing was that each time I pressed a number and error would pop up.
                               Almost like the game couldn't find the floor numbers. So I created an array were it could store all
                               the numbers that are currently ingame. Problem is it doesn't automatically check the floor numbers.
                               It only checks the manaully assigned floor numbers resulting in errors when you press an unassigned floor number.

                                By the end of this little project, i've improved my
                                developing skills alot during the development
                                process of this game.
                                I learned how to work with blueprints more efficiently.
                                This was a very fun experience and also very informational for me.
                                I also realized that I enjoy working with Unreal Engine more then working with Unity
                                this however does not mean I don't plan to continue with Unity. Overal this was a very cool
                                project that got me into Unreal Engine.

                                    This shows how the game ends when you have collected all coins.<br>
                                    The bridge opens up after you have collected all the coins it currently
                                    doesn't have any noise that confirms you collected every coin.
                                    but as soon as you press "E" on the bridge it will lower then you can walk
